        <h3>4.1 THIRD PARTIES THAT PROVIDE CONTENT OR FUNCTIONALITY ON OUR SERVICES</h3>
        <p>We partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use some of the Personal Information described in this Policy. For example:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Third-parties that provide features and functionality on the Services by means of plug-ins. Even if you do not click on or interact with social networking services or other plug-ins, they collect information about you, such as your IP address and the pages that you view.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Advertising providers help us and our advertisers provide advertisements on our Services or elsewhere, including advertisements that are targeted based on your online behavior, and analytics companies help us measure and evaluate the usage of our services.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Other content providers offer products and services on our Services and operate contests, sweepstakes, or surveys on our Services.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We, as well as certain of these third-party partners may use tracking tools (e.g., cookies, web beacons, and Internet technologies) to collect information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address or page(s) visited). For more information on these types of tracking tools, please see our&nbsp;<a class="sl_norewrite" href="https://www.wework.com/legal/cookie-policy">Cookies Policy</a>. We also share such information that we have collected with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) to deliver future targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-FlexBot related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as &ldquo;interest-based advertising&rdquo; or &ldquo;online behavioral advertising.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising.

        <h3>4.2 SOCIAL MEDIA</h3>
        <p>We are active on social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, etc.) and share information, images, and video with the public through unaffiliated external social media sites. We encourage you to read their policies. Remember that the social media sites are public, which means that anyone can see your posts, and your posts may even show up in search engine results.</p>
        <p>While we will not edit comments, we may delete a comment from our page on a social media site if it, for example, does not relate to the post, promotes a commercial product or service, uses obscene, threatening, or harassing language, or if it is a personal attack or hate speech that targets or disparages any ethnic, racial, age, or religious group (or other legally protected group), or if it advocates illegal activity or violates copyright laws.</p>
        <h2>5. RIGHTS IN YOUR INFORMATION: ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, ERASURE, AND RESTRICTION</h2>
        <p>We value your rights to your data. In accordance with applicable law, you may have the right to (i) request confirmation of whether we store, use, or share any of your Personal Information; (ii) obtain access to or a copy of your Personal Information; (iii) receive an electronic copy of Personal Information that you have provided to us, or ask us to send that information to another company (the &ldquo;right of data portability&rdquo;); (iv) restrict our uses of your Personal Information or, as described above, object to those uses; (v) seek correction of inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete Personal Information; or (vi) request erasure of Personal Information held about you by FlexBot, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@FlexBot.com or one of the physical addresses set out in Section 12.5 below.</p>
        <p>We will process such requests in accordance with local laws. To protect your privacy, FlexBot will take steps to verify your identity before granting access or making any changes to your Personal Information. The California Privacy Rights section below provides additional information for California residents.</p>
        <h2>6. OPT-OUT</h2>
        <p>You have the right to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information as set out in this Policy, and in specific circumstances, for example related to direct marketing.</p>
        <h3>6.1 GENERAL</h3>
        <p>Where you have consented to FlexBot&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; Personal Information (e.g., Personal Information relating to your health, religious or philosophical beliefs, or biometric information which is used to uniquely identify you) (&ldquo;Sensitive Personal Information&rdquo;), you may withdraw that consent, in accordance with applicable law.</p>
        <p>Prior to disclosing Sensitive Personal Information to a third party or processing Sensitive Data for a purpose other than its original purpose or a purpose authorized subsequently by the data subject, FlexBot will endeavor to obtain your explicit consent (opt-in). Where your consent for the processing of Personal Information is otherwise required by law or contract, FlexBot will comply with the law or contract.</p>
        <h3>6.2 EMAIL AND TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Opting-Out of Marketing Communications.</strong>&nbsp; We provide a means to unsubscribe in our marketing-related email communications. Note that we will continue to send transaction-related emails regarding products or services that you have requested following an unsubscribe. We may also need to send you certain communications regarding operation and administration of the Services, and you will not be able to opt out of those communications, e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Use or this Policy.

The Personal Information and other information that you provide to sign up or participate in that event or program will be available to that organization, and you may receive emails or other communications from it after the event. Please refer to that organization&rsquo;s privacy policy for information on how to opt-out of its communications.</p>

        <h3>6.3 COMPLIANCE WITH THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING ALLIANCE</h3>
        <p>Should FlexBot engage in interest-based advertising, it will endeavor to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) (<a class="sl_norewrite" href="https://www.aboutads.info/">http://aboutads.info</a>), as applicable. As part of this service, FlexBot&rsquo;s online advertisements may sometimes be delivered with icons that help individuals understand how their data are being used and provide options to restrict that use. To opt-out of internet-based advertising by all DAA-participating companies, please visit&nbsp;<a class="sl_norewrite" href="https://www.aboutads.info/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
        <h2>7. SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY</h2>
        <p>For visitors to our Services in the EU, you may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe our processing of your Personal Information infringes applicable law.</p>
        <h2>8. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h2>
        <p>FlexBot is headquartered in the United States. Your information will likely be collected in your country and subsequently transferred to or stored in another country, including countries that may have privacy protections less stringent than your jurisdiction. In accordance with applicable law, we implement measures, such as standard data protection clauses, to ensure that any transferred Personal Information remains protected and secure. You can obtain further information about these measures by contacting us using the contact details set out below in Section 12.5.</p>
        <h2>9. RETENTION</h2>
        <p>FlexBot will retain your Personal Information for as long as you have a relationship with us, and for a period after your relationship with us has ended.</p>
        <p>When determining how long this retention period will last, we take into account the length of time Personal Information is required to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Continue to develop, tailor, upgrade, and improve our Services;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Maintain business records for analysis and/or audit purposes;</p>

        <li>
        <p>Address any complaints regarding the Services.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>10. INFORMATION SECURITY</h2>
        <p>The security of all Personal Information provided to FlexBot is important to us. FlexBot takes reasonable steps endeavoring to use appropriate technical or organizational measures to protect your Personal Information, including against unauthorized or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction, or damage. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while FlexBot strives to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to FlexBot, and you do so at your own risk. As such, we ask that you help us be safer together by implementing your own security controls, such as a strong password, not sharing your credentials or badge with others, logging out when you leave your desk, and other security best practices.</p>
        <h2>11. AUTOMATED PROCESSING</h2>
        <p>In the future, we may use automated processes to help us determine your eligibility for new services, alternate space, or other business-related opportunities. In such cases, if and as applicable, and to the extent required by applicable law, we will endeavor to implement suitable safeguards, including, for example, an opportunity for you to request human intervention, express your point of view, contest any decisions made, or request that we restrict the use of your Personal Information for the purposes of these automated decisions.</p>
        <h2>12. OTHER RIGHTS AND IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h2>
        <h3>12.1 CCTV</h3>
        <p><strong>FlexBot</strong>&rsquo;s buildings and facilities have CCTV installed to meet our legitimate business interests in protecting the safety of FlexBot&rsquo;s employees, members, and guests and their property. These recordings may be accessed by FlexBot. FlexBot may also make CCTV footage available to members and other third parties authorized by FlexBot. These recordings may be shared with competent authorities in accordance with applicable laws, if required. The recordings are generally retained for a limited period of time, but may be kept longer where FlexBot or an applicable member determines that it is appropriate, for example in connection with the investigation of an incident, or when competent authorities request us to retain them.</p>
        <h3>12.2 THIRD PARTIES</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to services not provided by FlexBot. We display advertisements and other content from third parties or partners that link to third-party websites that we do not own or operate. We provide links to these third-party sites as a convenience to you. They are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked services. The linked services are subject to their separate and independent privacy statements, notices, and terms. Additionally, third parties may sell goods or offer services at our facilities or in combination with our Services. We are not responsible for those third parties&rsquo; services or their privacy practices.</p>
        <p>We cannot control or be held responsible for third parties&rsquo; privacy practices and content. Please read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your Personal Information prior to submitting any Personal Information. The collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party and not this Policy. We are not responsible for the data collection, privacy, and information sharing policies and procedures or content of such third-party websites.</p>
        <h3>12.3 CHANGES TO THIS POLICY IN THE FUTURE</h3>
        <p>Any information that is collected via the Services is covered by the Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Policy at any time and at our sole discretion.</p>

        <p>We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to remain informed of how we use and protect your information, and to be aware of any policy changes. Your continued relationship with us after the posting or notice of any amended Policy shall constitute your agreement to be bound by any such changes. Any changes to this Policy take effect immediately after being posted or otherwise provided by FlexBot.</p>

        <h2>13. JURISDICTION-SPECIFIC INFORMATION</h2>
        <p><strong>CCTV in the European Union/European Economic Area</strong></p>
        <p>FlexBot&rsquo;s CCTV practices are based on an assessment of the data protection interests of affected data subjects against our legitimate interests in maintaining a Secure Environment and otherwise protecting ourself and other members of our community. This may entail consideration, for example, of the likelihood and impact of unlawful or impermissible conduct on our communities and expectations of privacy in particular facilities or spaces that may be subject to CCTV.</p>
        <p>The recordings are generally retained for a limited period of time in accordance with Section 9 of this Global Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
        <p>California residents are entitled to request and obtain certain information about the disclosure of certain categories of their Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>Some web browsers may transmit &ldquo;do-not-track&rdquo; signals to the websites and other online services with which a user communicates. There is no industry standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard is established and accepted, we may revisit our policy on responding to these signals.</p>
        <p>California residents who are registered members or users of the Services and are under the age of 18 may be entitled under California law to request and obtain removal of content and information that they themselves post on the Services. You may request such removal by emailing us at privacy@FlexBot.com. In your request, please provide a description of the material that you want removed and information sufficient to permit us to locate the material, including your name, email address, year of birth, mailing address (including city, state, and zip code), and the subject line &ldquo;California Removal Request.&rdquo; Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the material. For example, materials that you have posted may be republished or reposted by another user or third party.</p>

        <p>We have tried to explain our privacy practices in full in the other sections of this Privacy Policy.
