                            <h6>A True Workplace Revolution </h6>
                            <p class="text-muted">A true workplace revolution, process automation & digital robotics is spreading quickly. As automation focused infrastructures become more integrated into our society, it’s important to acknowledge that it’s here to stay. In 2018 alone, the process automation market has grown 63.1%. This has saved companies millions in sunk cost handling simple tasks like billing, digital filing and other mundane, tedious, yet necessary processes. This makes it the fastest growing enterprise software market.</p>
                            
                            <h5>A Dynamic Shift :</h5>
                            <p class="text-muted">When this new tool first made its debut, many suspected and criticized that automation would make valuable workers lose their jobs, particularly workers who handle administrative tasks that are tedious and repetitive. The fact is this is untrue, nobody enjoys this repetition, ergo why not free up these tasks and use human capital for a more important purpose. </p>
                            <p class="text-muted">Companies looking to utilize these tools can maximize worker output while making their work easier and quicker. Gone are the days of endlessly sorting, organizing and entering data over hours at a time. If it’s robotic in nature, why not pass it to your #DigitalRobot?</p>
                            
                            <p class="text-muted">When considering whether process automation works in a company is dependant on a few key notes:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="list-unstyled feature-list text-muted">
                                <li><i class="mdi mdi-pan-right mdi-24px mr-2"></i>There must be an innovative management team in place with strategic visions</li>
                                <li><i class="mdi mdi-pan-right mdi-24px mr-2"></i>The IT department must be universally willing to work with RPA </li>
                                <li><i class="mdi mdi-pan-right mdi-24px mr-2"></i>There must be a business use case that considers many benefits that process automation can offer</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="text-muted">Once these factors are taken into consideration, process automation implementation outcomes are dependent not only on how it benefits a company and customers, but also how it benefits employees. This software is able to free a team-member from these never ending monotonous tasks, allowing more opportunity to work on other value adding skills and develop better relationships with colleagues and clients. </p>
                            
                            <p class="text-muted">Once the Process is found and Automated with oversight of a human, the worker and management will notice a decrease in </p>
                            
                            <ul class="list-unstyled feature-list text-muted">
                                <li><i class="mdi mdi-pan-right mdi-24px mr-2"></i>Human error & associated costs</li>
                                <li><i class="mdi mdi-pan-right mdi-24px mr-2"></i>Time spent & cost per process </li>
                                <li><i class="mdi mdi-pan-right mdi-24px mr-2"></i>Employee stress & related dissatisfaction</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>FlexBot’s Process Automation Software </h5>
                            <p class="text-muted">With any new technology, it’s important to provide easy to understand and implement software. In one survey done by Forrester Consulting, 43% of companies in the survey found it hard to understand the automation options available. Companies often have issues scaling these process automation solutions due to a lack of professionals competent in this field. Flexbot has and will continue to develop these easy to use softwares provide assistance in  walking through the process to make this scalability easier. Process automation is not magic it’s not a robot overthrow, it is not the matrix’s first steps; it is a tool that will make lives easier in the right hands. </p>
                            
                            <h5>The Future of Process Automation </h5>
                            <p class="text-muted">Estimates say that the process automation industry will be worth 2.9 billion by 2021; that’s an over 350% increase from 2018 and it does not look to be slowing down. Because of this rapid growth, the time for implementing these processes has never been better and it’s important for companies and professionals to be aware of these developments. </p>
