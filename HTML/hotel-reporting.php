                            <h5>Overview :</h5>
                            <h6>Lead Generation Automation </h6>
                            <p class="text-muted">One of the largest hotel companies worldwide and the leader within their market, with more than 380 hotels throughout more than 40 countries and four continents. The strategic focus on international growth has allowed them to be the first hotel company in itâ€™s local with presence in key markets such as China, the Arabian Gulf and the US, as well as maintaining its leadership in traditional markets such as Europe, Latin America or the Caribbean</p>

                            <h5>Challenge:</h5>
                            <p class="text-muted">With an aggressive growth plan in a new market, coupled with the need to provide greater operational visibility to Hotel Operations Managers, the Finance Management department determined that they needed a cost-effective and efficient way to deliver accurate, daily and timely management reporting to each Hotel Operator in order to help them manage their business operations more proactively and achieve their financial goals.</p>
                            <p class="text-muted">If done manually, the creation of these daily reports would be very time-consuming and prone to errors as it would require the compilation and analysis of data from multiple sources and systems (6 different reports from each POS system at each hotel location).</p>
                            <p class="text-muted">Since the company did not want to heavily invest in an expensive Business Intelligence IT initiative, they had initially considered outsourcing the preparation of these reports to an offshore provider in a different time zone so they could have the reports readily available by 9:00 am local time.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Solution:</h5>
                            <p class="text-muted">Digital robotics & automation was used in the creation and distribution of these daily reports. The daily report includes multiple relevant performance metrics such as revenue vs. forecast, no shows, occupancy, average night spend, etc.</p>
                            <p class="text-muted">And of course, it was issued daily by 9:00 am each morning.</p>

                            <h5>Results:</h5>
                            <p class="text-muted">The process was successfully automated within the estimated 8-week timeframe for the first wave of five (5) hotel locations that were included in the Proof of Concept (POC). Given the great success, they are now in the process of rolling out this report to all of the hotels globally.</p>
